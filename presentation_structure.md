## Slide 7: Data Flow
**Title**: How RAG Works in Our System
```
1. Document Ingestion: Text → Embeddings → Vector Storage
2. Query Processing: Question → Embedding → Similarity Search
3. Context Retrieval: Relevant chunks retrieved from vector DB
4. Response Generation: Context + Query → LLM → Answer
```
